here’s how i thought about it. this problem is like a word version of the game mastermind. you get to guess words, and each time, the master.guess() function tells you how many letters are exactly right — meaning correct letter and correct position. the key is to use that feedback to filter out the wrong words. for example, if i guess "abcczz" and get a 4, then i know the secret word must match "abcczz" in exactly 4 positions. so i go through the list and only keep the words that also have 4 matches with "abcczz". that way, every guess helps me shrink the list of possibilities.

as for the line wordlist = candidates.toArray(new String[0]);, it's just converting the filtered candidates list back into an array because the original wordlist was an array. the new String[0] is just java boilerplate — it doesn’t mean we’re making an array of size 0, it just gives toArray() a type to work with. this code basically loops until either you find the word or hit the guess limit, using the match count to guide you each time.
