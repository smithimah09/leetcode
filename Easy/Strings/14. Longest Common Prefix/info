basically, this problem is asking for the longest prefix that all strings in the array share — something that appears at the start of every single word. the intuitive way to think about this is to assume the first word is the longest possible prefix, and then slowly shrink it down as we check the rest of the words.

so we start by grabbing the first string and storing it as our currentcompare prefix. we also store its length, since we’ll be slicing it as needed. then, we go through each of the remaining strings. if the current string doesn’t start with our prefix, or is shorter than it, we shrink the prefix down one character at a time by shortening its length. we keep doing that until it matches the start of the current string, or we shrink it all the way down to nothing. if we ever hit length zero, that means there’s no common prefix at all, so we just return an empty string.

the while condition is doing exactly this: making sure we trim the prefix until it actually fits at the start of the string we’re comparing it to. once we make it through all the strings, the prefix we’re left with is the longest one that works for all of them. it’s just a clean, greedy approach that starts with the biggest guess and narrows it down.
