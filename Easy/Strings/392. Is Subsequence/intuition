basically the problem wants to know if every character in s shows up in t in the same order. they don’t have to be right next to each other, just appear in sequence. so to solve this, instead of comparing every character in s to every character in t with two nested for loops (which would be super inefficient), the key realization is that we only care about moving forward through both strings — we’re not going back to re-check anything.

so we set up two pointers, one for s and one for t, and we walk through t from left to right. every time we see a character in t that matches the current character in s, we move the s pointer forward, since that character has now been found in order. otherwise, we just move the t pointer to keep scanning. we don't move s unless there’s a match.

the loop condition comes from that logic — we keep going while we haven’t reached the end of either string. once the s pointer reaches the end, it means all characters in s were found in order in t, so we return true. if we reach the end of t first and haven’t matched all of s, we return false. the while loop replaces what two for-loops would try to do inefficiently, by only checking the characters we need and skipping unnecessary work. this makes it both intuitive and optimal.
