basically, the goal is to check if a string is a palindrome — meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards — but only considering letters and numbers, and ignoring case. so first, we clean up the string: make it lowercase and remove everything that’s not a letter or digit. that gives us a version of the string that’s safe to compare character by character.

then comes the actual palindrome check. instead of reversing the string and comparing it to the original, we use two pointers — one starting at the beginning, one at the end. this is because we only care about whether the first character equals the last, the second equals the second-to-last, and so on. so we move both pointers toward the middle, comparing as we go. if at any point the characters don’t match, we can stop immediately and return false. if we make it through the whole loop without finding a mismatch, then the string is a palindrome, and we return true.

the while condition sp <= tp just means “keep checking until the two pointers meet or cross,” which covers both even- and odd-length strings. the reason this approach works so well is because it avoids unnecessary work like creating a reversed copy — it just checks what needs to be checked in-place, clean and efficient.
