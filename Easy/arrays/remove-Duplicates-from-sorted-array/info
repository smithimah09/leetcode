## intuition:
you’re going through a sorted array and want to keep only the unique elements. since it’s sorted, duplicates will be next to each other.
you use a pointer called unique_holder to mark the spot where the next unique number should go. start from the second element and compare each number with the last unique one you saved.
if it’s different, move the pointer forward and copy the new number there. at the end, everything from index 0 to unique_holder will be the unique part of the array. return unique_holder + 1 because that’s the length.
