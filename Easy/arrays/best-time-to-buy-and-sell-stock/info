you walk through the list of prices, and at every step, you ask two questions:

is today’s price lower than the cheapest price i’ve seen so far?
 → if yes, update the buy price.

if i bought at that cheapest price, and sold today, would i make more profit than i’ve seen before?
 → if yes, update the max profit.

you’re not committing to a real buy or sell. you're just pretending at each step:
"what if i had bought at the lowest price so far — would today be a great time to sell?"

important mental rule
you're not deciding when to buy/sell in real time.
you’re simulating a buy at the cheapest price so far
and testing if today would’ve been the best time to sell so far.
no matter how weird the prices get, this keeps working.
