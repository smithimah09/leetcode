what helped me with this one was just looking at the input and output closely—like the words aren’t changed at all, they’re just in reverse order with clean spacing. once i saw that, i knew i just had to split the string by spaces, loop backwards, and rebuild the sentence. also using a `StringBuilder` instead of `+=` made it faster since string concatenation in java is kinda slow when done in loops.
