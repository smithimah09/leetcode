intuition
you want the product of everything except the current number, but can’t use division.
so you build the answer in two passes.

first pass (left to right):
for each index, store the product of everything before it using a running curr.
this gives you:
[1, 1, 2, 6] for [1, 2, 3, 4]

second pass (right to left):
now go backward, track the product of everything after using curr again, and multiply it into the result.
final answer becomes:
[24, 12, 8, 6]

no division, no extra space — just prefix * suffix in-place.
done ✅
