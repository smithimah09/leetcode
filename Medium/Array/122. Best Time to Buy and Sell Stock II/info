basically, every time the stock goes up from one day to the next, we want to grab that profit.
you’re allowed to buy and sell as many times as you want — just not at the same time. so if price goes up, you "pretend" to buy the day before and sell today to take the profit.
so you walk through the array, and each day you ask:

“hey, is today’s price higher than yesterday’s?”
if yes → grab that profit
if no → just move on

currentBuy = prices[i];
why do we do this every time?

it’s because we need to always track today’s price so we can check if tomorrow’s price goes up or not.

we’re not actually "buying" again — we’re just updating the price we’re comparing the next day to.
